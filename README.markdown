## Overview
A interactive ToDo list with JQuery. The task was to:

1. A todo may be added to the page.
2. A todo may be marked as complete.
3. A todo may be removed from the page.


### Next Steps
[ ] Refactor code. Break down into more functions.

[ ] When creating lists, you often want to reorder them. Use [HTML5 Drag and
Drop](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/) events to allow manual
sorting of the todo list.
